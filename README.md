# Line-Follower
Autonomous Line follower, started as a part of [SDP 2.0](https://www.niser.ac.in/~smishra/club/rtc/skill-development-program/) in attempt for competitions.  
***1st Runners-up*** in Line Follower, [NIRMAN 2.0](https://www.nirmansilicon.tech/), Silicon Institute, Bhubaneswar.

# Working Idea
# Code (Arduino)
Written on Arduino. There are two version: 
- Case-wise (_Used in NIRMAN_)
- PID
# Circuit

# Chassis 
The top screw holes might be a bit off.
